# Summary

This is a great design that I've dialed in and got working very well. Looks great and is very functional. This stand allows multiple viewing angles and best of all has a quick grab/release mechanism that grabs and locks the phone in when you let go and releases when you pick up the phone. 

This design currently works best for larger phones (iPhone 8 plus/XS Max size), but I am working on a universal version, just need to get my hands on the smaller devises to test and dial it in.

The entire design is printable other than a small extension spring that needs to be installed when putting the stand together.

5mm x 10mm extension springs work great and can be found in this kit for a great price:

To connect the spring attach to the each piece first as shown then flip it over and attach the other side to the post in the spring channel on the front panel. Attach the arms to their respective gears, and place the sliders in place.

After securing the spring to both points put the rack, gears and arms in place, and get ready to secure the back panel with bolts.

Only secure the back panel with the bottom bolts, using short bolts. Insert the 3 finger mount into the mount bracket and bolt onto the back panel securing the rest of the mount.
