# Summary

I made this nut and bolt toy for my daughter. It should print well on most printers, mine was done with PLA filament, with a bed temperature of 60c, and the extruder at 215c. 

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: Ender 3
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Infill: 20%

# Post-Printing

## Getting the nut and bolt to fit

The nut and bolt should fit just fine, although depending on your printer and any artefacts that you might have, you may have to use a little force to get them to screw together. Do this a few times and they will work well. 

A little light sanding should remove any imperfections and make it feel a little nicer to little hands. 

# How I Designed This

## Fusion 360 plus the thread tool

Very simply designed in Fusion 360, using polygons and cylinder plus the thread tool. Edges are chamfered for little hands.
