# Summary

##Mount for Dremel Multipro 395## 
...for a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:790533" target="_blank">MPCNC</a> using the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1697287" target="_blank">Universal Tool-Mount Plate</a> I also made for it.

------

<h5>With/out -Support</h5>
The version with support in the filenames is with build-in supports. The other version is if you like to print without or use your own support system

-----

##Parts##
<ul><li>There is the <strong>Dremel Main Mount</strong> part.</li>
<li>A <strong>Wide Clamp</strong> and the <strong>Front Clamp</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Front Ring</strong> you screw onto the threadding of your Dremel instead of the Dremel end.</li></ul>

----
<strong>Updates</strong>
Uploaded combined STP file.
Put in note that it's not compatible with Dremel 3000


# Print Settings

Printer: My Crossbot design
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 44 or higher

Notes: 
<ul><li>I used 0.4mm nozzle</li>
<li>3 perimeters</li>
<li>3 bottom/top</li>
<li>44% infill (higher is better)</li>
<li>Use strong infill pattern: I used Tethrahedral in Cura 2.3</li>
<li>I have printed it without support with high speed fans, so it is doable, but it's easier to just use the version with build-in support</li>
</ul>


# Post-Printing

## Parts cleanup.

<strong>Intentioanlly tight tolerances</strong>
There is a 0,2mm space between each hinge-parts. It means you might at first be unable to put them together if you have slight overextrude or just by normal Filament contraction.

<strong>Why?</strong>
I didn't want any wobble in the hinges.

<strong>M4 lock-nuts insertion into the Mount</strong>
Use a small plier to hold the lock-nuts and use a M4 screw to tighten up the nuts into the holes made for them in the Dremel Main Mount. 
1 for each clamping mechanism.

It had <i>almost</i> the right dimensions.... not quite but ok for illustrations.
